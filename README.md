EPT: An R package for ensemble patch transform
The primary focus of multiscale analysis is to interpret the temporal characteristics of
one-dimensional signals, and local spatial patterns of two-dimensional images
according to the scale variability. There have been numerous studies for multiscale
analysis in the literature. 
Those include Spectral analysis, wavelet analysis, empirical mode decomposition,
synchrosqueezed wavelet transforms, and variational mode decomposition. These
methodologies have been widely applied in various areas, and can be easily
implemented by Matlab and R package. Recently, ensemble patch transform was
developed for multiscale analysis of one-dimensional signal and two-dimensional
image. For researchers and practitioners of multidisciplinary areas, we provide the R
package  EPT  for an efficient implementation of the ensemble patch transform. The
package flexibly designs various type of filters for identifying local characteristics and
scale patterns hidden in a signal and the spatial characteristics of an image. R
package EPT  also provides effective tool for visualization and decomposition of
signals and images.
